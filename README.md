# Recipe Search

This will be a tool where you can create and search for recipes based on multiple parameters such as cuisine (e.g mexican, indian), diet (e.g. vegan, pescatarian) or ingredients (e.g. pasta, rice, chicken)

It will return cards with a title and thumbnail for the recipe and some basic information which can be clicked to take you to the recipe

Frontend built using React.js

Work in progress deployed at https://recipe-search-tibo.netlify.app/

Here is an example of how creating a recipe works
