# Recipe Search

This will be a tool where you can search for recipes based on multiple parameters such as cuisine (e.g mexican, indian), diet (e.g. vegan, pescatarian) or ingredients (e.g. pasta, rice, chicken)

It will return cards with a title and thumbnail for the recipe and some basic information which can be clicked to take you to the recipe

Built using React.js
