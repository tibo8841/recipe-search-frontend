# Recipe Search

This is a tool where you can create and search for recipes based on multiple parameters such as cuisine (e.g mexican, indian), diet (e.g. vegan, pescatarian) or ingredients (e.g. pasta, rice, chicken)

It returns cards with a title and thumbnail for the recipe and some basic information which can be clicked to take you to the recipe
